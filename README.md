A lisp written in rust.

I want to learn rust and clojure at the same time. But I dont have all the time in the world. So, in order to kill 1.5 birds with one stone I decided to follow [this](https://buildyourownlisp.com/) with a little help with [this](https://dev.to/deciduously/rust-your-own-lisp-50an) to learn rust and also understand how lisp works. With a good enough understanding of lisp to be able to write an interpreter for it should give me a good foundation for learning clojure. With the obvious added bonus of rounding out my rust skills.

Parser:
 Using [Pest](https://github.com/pest-parser/pest). I have borrowed from their [j-language example](https://pest.rs/book/examples/jlang.html) and I will be building on that. 
 Pest is awesome
